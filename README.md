### Project Assignment: Machine Learning Model Deployment

Objective: This weekâ€™s project involves selecting a machine learning (ML) dataset of your choice to build an ML model. For simplicity, choose a straightforward dataset or one you have previously worked with. Follow the steps covered in our last class session.

#### Steps:

##### **1. Create a GitHub Repository:**

Set up a GitHub repository containing the code necessary to build and upload a Docker image to the AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

##### **2. Execute on SageMaker:**

Ensure the code can be executed via orchestrator.py on SageMaker.

Configure the appropriate IAM permissions for the user and roles required to run the training job.

##### **3. Documentation and Blog:**

Document your process and write a concise blog article including a link to your code repository.

Incorporate visuals such as diagrams and screenshots to enhance your documentation.

##### **4. Optional Challenge:**

If you are feeling adventurous, try using a Jupyter Notebook instead of a training script. Explore how to invoke this via a Docker image when running the SageMaker job. (Hint: Papermill)
